# Check the DCS status

You can check the status of the Document Checking Service (DCS) by making a HTTP GET request to the service endpoint.

We recommend clients use this endpoint to build appropriate levels of reliability into their service.

## Request

Checking the status of the Document Checking Service is an HTTP GET request

The end point is https://<DCS-URI>/checks/passport

The request to this endpoint is a plain JSON document detailing the service status and does not require signing and encryption.

## Response

When DCS is unavailable, the `message` field will contain one of the following:

* `Limit exceeded` - The client has exceeded their quota of API calls
* `Planned outage in progress finishing <TIMESTAMP>` - Either HMPO or the Document Checking Service are in a period of scheduled downtime, ending at `<TIMESTAMP>`
* `Unplanned outage` - Either HMPO or the Document Checking Service are experiencing a period of unscheduled downtime 

For example, if you made the request during an outage period the JSON object in the response body without the [signature and encryption wrapper][cryptography] will be similar to:

```json
{
  "available": false,
  "message": "Planned outage in progress finishing 2019-09-12T00:00:00.000Z",
  "scheduledOutages":
    [
      {
      	"start":"2019-09-05T00:00:00.000Z",
      	"end":"2019-09-12T00:00:00.000Z",
      	"message":"HMPO is doing some maintenance work."
      }
    ]
}
```
