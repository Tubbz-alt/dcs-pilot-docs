# Status response codes

The Document Checking Service (DCS) uses standard HTTP response code conventions.

| HTTP response code | Description                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 200                | DCS handled your request successfully. |
| 404                | The DCS URI is incorrect.              |
| 429                | Request rate is above the rate limit.  |
| 5xx                | There is an internal DCS server error. |

Note that the `HTTP 200` response code means DCS handled your request successfully. It makes no statement about whether the check found a valid document or not. An `HTTP 200` also doesn't make any statements about the operational status.
