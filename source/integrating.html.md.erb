# Integrating with DCS

Before you are allowed to connect to the DCS production environment, you will be required to test your API implementation in the DCS integration environment provided by GDS.
The integration environment contains test data to help check that your application can handle all success and failure cases ([see diagram legend][message-flow] and [status codes][status-response-codes]). 

The process to integrating with the DCS integration and production environments include:

1. Request and receive [signing][cryptography-signing] and [encryption][cryptography-encryption] certificates, signed from our Certificate Authority. (integration)
2. Create a public-private key pair ([PKI][RFC 6712]) and share them with DCS. This is to establish mutual-TLS (mTLS). (integration)
3. Develop a client that connects using the DCS API, in your chosen programming language(s).
4. Test the connection and functionality by connecting to the DCS integration environment.

After steps 1-4 has been finished, and your application successfully can handle all response scenarios, you will be asked to repeat the steps 1, 2 and 4 for the production environment.

We aim to iterate our connecting process to continue to improve how organisations technically connect. Participants can expect that some things will change during the connecting window as we improve the process.
