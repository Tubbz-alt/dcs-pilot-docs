# Status response codes

The Document Checking Service (DCS) uses standard [HTTP response code][HTTP-Status-Code] conventions.

| HTTP response code | Description                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| 200                | The DCS handled your request successfully. |
| 404                | The DCS URI is incorrect.              |
| 429                | You have exceeded your allocated number of API calls.  |
| 503                | The requested government service is experiencing a planned outage |
| 5xx                | There is an internal server error. |

Note that the `HTTP 200` response code means the DCS handled your request successfully. It does not confirm whether the passport is valid or not. Likewise, an `HTTP 200` does not necessarily mean that the DCS is operational.
