## Pre-requisites

Before you start to build a client there are several things you need.

### DCS URI
There is one URI for the production environment, and one URI for the integration environment. These will be provided when your pilot application is approved.

### Access to DCS Certificate Authority portals
You will be provided URIs to access to our Certificate Authority portals in order to submit a Certificate Signing Request.
There is one portal for each environment you need to raise Certificate Signing Request (CSR) with.

Each DCS environment has its own Certificate Authority portal where you can submit your CSR.

### Certificates and Keys
There are two sets of certificates and keys that you need to call the DCS:

There are two environments that you will need to integrate with:

* the DCS integration environment
* the DCS production environment

Each environment requires their own keys and certificates.

You can read about [how to generate keys and request certificates][keys-and-certificates] in this documentation.

#### Your certificates and keys

| No. |   Purpose   |     Type    |    Origin    |           Usage               |
|-----|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
|  1  | Signing     | Private Key | You generate | You use to sign your requests |
|  2  | Signing     | Certificate | You generate CSR from private key and submit to CA portal | DCS uses to validate your client's requests signature |
|  3  | Encryption  | Private Key | You generate | You use to decrypt responses from DCS |
|  4  | Encryption  | Certificate | You generate CSR from private key and submit to CA portal | DCS uses it to encrypt its responses to your client |
|  5  | mTLS        | Private Key | You generate |     Your mTLS configuration   |
|  6  | mTLS        | Certificate | You generate CSR from private key and submit to CA portal | Your mTLS configuration

#### DCS certificates

These certificates will be provided to you when your pilot application has been approved:

| No. |   Purpose   |     Type    |    Origin    |           Usage               |
|-----|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
|  1  | Signing     | Certificate | DCS supplies | Used to validate DCS response signatures |
|  2  | Encryption  | Certificate | DCS supplies | Used to encrypt your request payloads   |
|  3  | mTLS        | CA Bundle   | DCS supplies | Chain of trust for your mTLS configuration |
