# Integrating with the Document Checking Service

To digitally check the validity of British passports as part of the [Document Checking Service (DCS) pilot][govuk-link], you must integrate with the DCS API. There are several steps you must complete to integrate with the DCS API:

1. Develop a client to integrate with the DCS API.
1. Test your client in a dedicated DCS test environment.
1. Run your client in the production environment as part of the DCS pilot.

It's up to you to decide which programming language your client is using. Your client must be able to [handle authentication][mutual-auth] against the DCS API.

You must test your client in the dedicated test environment provided by the Government Digital Service (GDS) before getting access to the production environment. This environment contains test data to help you check that your application can handle all responses from the [DCS API][api-reference]. Once your client can handle all responses from the DCS API, you can connect to the DCS production environment.

## Pre-requisites

Before you start to build a client there are several things you need.

### DCS URI
There is one URI for the production environment, and one URI for the integration environment. These will be provided when your pilot application is approved.

### Access to DCS Certificate Authority portals
You will be provided URIs to access to our Certificate Authority portals in order to submit a Certificate Signing Request.
There is one portal for each environment you need to raise Certificate Signing Request (CSR) with.

Each DCS environment has its own Certificate Authority portal where you can submit your CSR.

### Certificates and Keys
There are two sets of certificates and keys that you need to call the DCS:

There are two environments that you will need to integrate with:

* the DCS integration environment
* the DCS production environment

Each environment requires their own keys and certificates.

#### Your certificates and keys

| No. |   Purpose   |     Type    |    Origin    |           Usage               |
|-----|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
|  1  | Signing     | Private Key | You generate | You use to sign your requests |
|  2  | Signing     | Certificate | You generate CSR from private key and submit to CA portal | DCS uses to validate your client's requests signature |
|  3  | Encryption  | Private Key | You generate | You use to decrypt responses from DCS |
|  4  | Encryption  | Certificate | You generate CSR from private key and submit to CA portal | DCS uses it to encrypt its responses to your client |
|  5  | mTLS        | Private Key | You generate |     Your mTLS configuration   |
|  6  | mTLS        | Certificate | You generate CSR from private key and submit to CA portal | Your mTLS configuration

#### DCS certificates

These certificates will be provided to you when your pilot application has been approved:

| No. |   Purpose   |     Type    |    Origin    |           Usage               |
|-----|-------------|-------------|--------------|-------------------------------|
|  1  | Signing     | Certificate | DCS supplies | Used to validate DCS request signatures |
|  2  | Encryption  | Certificate | DCS supplies | Used to encrypt your request payloads   |
|  3  | mTLS        | CA Bundle   | DCS supplies | Chain of trust for your mTLS configuration |


## How to request your public certificates

The DCS requires your public certificates to be signed by our CA.

To get your certificates, you need to:

1. create a private key
2. create a CSR from your private key
3. navigate to the relevant Certificate Authority portal (integration or production)
4. submit the CSR

You will be provided with your public certificates via email when the CSR has been signed by our Certificate Authority.
