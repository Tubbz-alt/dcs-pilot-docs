# How the DCS works

The Document Checking Service (DCS) acts as an interface between your service and HM Passport Office.

<%= image_tag "dcs-overview.svg", { :alt => '' } %>

1. Your service sends a passport check request to the DCS.
1. The DCS validates the request and sends it to HM Passport Office.
1. HM Passport Office checks the passport data against their database and sends a response back to the DCS.
1. The DCS sends the response to your service.

## Integrating with the DCS

You’ll need to build a client to integrate with the DCS. You can choose which programming language your client uses. There is a [worked example of creating a DCS connection](https://github.com/alphagov/dcs-python-client) on GitHub.

Your client will need to be able to sign and encrypt JSON data and make HTTP requests to DCS.

To build a working DCS client, you'll need to:

1. [Generate keys and request certificates](/generate-keys-and-request-certificates/#generate-keys-and-request-certificates) - you’ll [contact DCS support](/support/#support) to get the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) information so you can get started with integrating with the DCS.
1. [Create a network connection to the DCS](/create-a-network-connection/#create-a-network-connection-to-the-dcs) using mutual authentication.
1. [Set up your JOSE certificate thumbprints](/Set-up-your-JOSE-certificate-thumbprints/#set-up-your-jose-certificate-thumbprints).
1. [Sign and encrypt a DCS payload](/sign-and-encrypt-a-DCS-payload/#sign-and-encrypt-a-dcs-payload).
1. [Access the data in a DCS response](/access-the-data-in-a-DCS-response/#access-the-data-in-a-dcs-response).

### Using client libraries when connecting to the DCS

Currently, there are no supported client libraries for the DCS.

However, there is a [worked example of creating a DCS connection](https://github.com/alphagov/dcs-python-client) on GitHub.

## Understand what responses mean when making a DCS check

When you make a [DCS passport validity check](/api-reference/#check-whether-a-passport-is-valid), the DCS will return one of 3 responses:

* `valid: true`
* `valid: false`
* `error: true`

### Receiving a `valid: true` response

A `valid: true` response means:

* all the details on the passport, for example, first names or date of birth, exactly match the details held in Her Majesty’s Passport Office (HMPO)
* the passport is not marked as lost, stolen or cancelled in the HMPO database
* the passport has not expired, or expired no more than 18 months ago

### Receiving a `valid: false` response

A `valid: false` response means:

* one or more of the passport details, for example first names or date of birth, does not exactly match the details in the HMPO database
* the passport is marked as lost, stolen or cancelled in the HMPO database
* HMPO has not yet sent the passport to the holder

It’s possible for a valid passport to return a `valid: false` response. Check how to [reduce errors when using data from a passport chip](/reading-data-from-passport-nfc-chip/#reduce-errors-when-using-data-from-a-passport-chip).

### Receiving an `error: true` response

An `error: true` response means the HMPO database is unavailable. You should wait a few seconds and then try again.

## Getting access to production

Before you can access production, you'll need to:

+ successfully complete a full journey in the integration environment
+ show your organisation meets the [DCS pilot requirements](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/requirements-for-joining-the-document-checking-service-pilot) - the DCS team will contact you about this separately

You’ll need a different set of keys and certificates for your production connection.
[Contact the DCS pilot helpdesk](/support) if you’re ready to request access to production.
