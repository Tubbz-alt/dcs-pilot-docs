# How the DCS works

The Document Checking Service (DCS) acts as an interface between your service and HM Passport Office.

<%= image_tag "dcs-overview.svg", { :alt => '' } %>

This diagram shows:

1. Your service sends a passport check request to the DCS.
1. The DCS validates the request and sends it to HM Passport Office.
1. HM Passport Office checks the passport data against their database and sends a response back to the DCS.
1. The DCS sends the response to your service.

## Integrating with the DCS

You’ll need to build a client to integrate with the DCS. You can choose which programming language your client uses.

Your client will need to be able to sign and encrypt JSON data and make HTTP requests to DCS.

To build a working DCS client, you'll need to:

1. [Generate keys and request certificates](/generate-keys-and-request-certificates/#generate-keys-and-request-certificates) - you’ll [contact DCS support](/support/#support) to get the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) information so you can get started with integrating with the DCS.
1. [Create a network connection to the DCS](/create-a-network-connection/#create-a-network-connection-to-the-dcs) using mutual authentication.
1. [Set up your JOSE certificate thumbprints](/Set-up-your-JOSE-certificate-thumbprints/#set-up-your-jose-certificate-thumbprints).
1. [Sign and encrypt a DCS payload](/sign-and-encrypt-a-DCS-payload/#sign-and-encrypt-a-dcs-payload).
1. [Access the data in a DCS response](/access-the-data-in-a-DCS-response/#access-the-data-in-a-dcs-response).

## Getting access to production

Before you can access production, you'll need to:

+ successfully complete a full journey in the test environment
+ show your organisation meet the [DCS pilot requirements](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/requirements-for-joining-the-document-checking-service-pilot) - the DCS team will contact you about this separately 

You’ll need a different set of keys and certificates for your production connection.
[Contact the DCS pilot helpdesk](/support) if you’re ready to request access to production.
