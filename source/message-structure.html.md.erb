# Message structure


## Cryptography

Mutual-auth [Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2][TLS] secures the messages your client exchanges with the Document Checking Service (DCS).

Our Certificate Authority provides certificates for the public key infrastructure (PKI). Details about how to raise a certificate signing request with our Certificate Authority will follow after the Expression of Interest phase.

Messages your client exchanges with DCS must use the following IETF standards:

 - [Javascript Object Signing and Encryption (JOSE)][JOSE]
 - [JSON Web Signature (JWS)][JWS]
 - [JSON Web Encryption (JWE)][JWE]

### Signing

Requests must be signed using RSASSA-PKCS1-V1_5 with RS256s, which corresponds to using SHA256 in the JWE “alg” header.

### Encryption

Requests must be encrypted using RSAES OAEP with A128CBC-HS256 (which uses a SHA256 HMAC), corresponding to the JWE “enc” header.
