# Document Checking Service 

Use the Document Checking Service (DCS) Application Programming Interface (API) to check and validate passport data to establish identity.

## Document Checking Service pilot

The documents on this website are intended for participants of the DCS pilot. They explains the basic concepts of 
how to interact with the DCS API. It also provides an overview of the different functions the API supports.

Selected pilot participants will individually be onboarded during a 'conecting window', starting from the beginning of 2020.
Due to the iterative nature of the oboarding process, participants can expect that the process may change between iterations as we improve the process.
