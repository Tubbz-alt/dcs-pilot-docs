# Document Checking Service pilot

This technical documentation is for organisations taking part in the Document Checking Service (DCS) pilot. 

You can use the DCS to check digitally whether a given British passport is valid or not.

GDS will onboard selected pilot participants during a ‘connecting window’ starting in early 2020. 

## Integrating with the DCS API

To integrate your service with the DCS API you will need to:

1. Develop a client to integrate with the DCS API.
1. Test your client in a dedicated DCS test environment.
1. Run your client in the production environment as part of the DCS pilot.

It's up to you to decide which programming language your client uses.

This documentation explains [how the DCS works] and provides step by step guidance on how to:

+ generate keys and request certificates for your DCS connection
+ set up a mutual TLS connection to DCS
+ sign and encrypt a DCS payload
+ handle responses from the DCS 

## Getting access to production

You'll need to successfully complete a full journey in the test environment before you can get access to the production environment.

You'll need a different set of keys and certificates for your production connection.

Contact the [DCS pilot helpdesk](/support) if you're ready to request access to production.
