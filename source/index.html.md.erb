# The Document Checking Service pilot

This technical documentation is for organisations taking part in the [Document Checking Service (DCS) pilot][govuk-link]. The pilot will allow organisations to digitally check the validity of British passports.

We will start onboarding selected pilot participants in early 2020.

We will be refining the onboarding process as we go, and participants should therefore be aware that the process may change between iterations.
