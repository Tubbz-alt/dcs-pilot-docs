# Document Checking Service 

Use the Document Checking Service (DCS) Application Programming Interface (API) to check and validate passport data to establish identity.

## Document Checking Service pilot

The documents on this website are intended for participants of the DCS pilot and explain how to interact with the DCS API. It also provides an overview of the different functions the API supports.

Selected pilot participants will be onboarded individually during a 'connecting window' starting from the beginning of 2020.
We will be refining the onboarding process as we go, and as such participants should be aware that the process may change between iterations.
