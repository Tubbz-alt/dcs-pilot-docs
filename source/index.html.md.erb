# Document Checking Service pilot

What are you getting when checking the doc - you get a yes/no for each request.


We need to have an intro about:

* what the website contains
* what it's intended for
* state of completion

We also need to make sure we link to other places in the docs

If selected to take part in the pilot, you will be onboarded during a ‘connecting window’ from the start of 2020.

We aim to iterate our connecting process to continue to improve how organisations technically connect. Participants can expect that some things will change during the connecting window as we improve the process.
