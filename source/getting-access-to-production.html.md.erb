# Request access to production

After you have built a working client, you can request access to the DCS production environment.

[Contact the DCS team](/support) to request access to production. You'll need to confirm your service:

+ is ready to use, for example, once you're connected to production someone could use it for the purpose set out in the use case you submitted as part of your DCS pilot application
+ has [successfully handled the 3 outcomes from the test requests](/send-a-test-request-to-the-DCS) you sent to the DCS integration environment (`valid: true`, `valid: false` and `error: true`)
+ has an auditing system set up to keep a record of each request you make to DCS, including the [requestID and timestamp](https://dcs-pilot-docs.cloudapps.digital/sign-and-encrypt-a-DCS-payload/#build-a-plain-json-payload) of each request

The DCS team will get in touch with you with the next steps.
