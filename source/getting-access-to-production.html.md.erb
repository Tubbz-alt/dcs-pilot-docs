# Request access to production

After you have built a working client, you can request access to the DCS production environment.

[Contact the DCS team][support] to request access to production. You'll need to confirm that:

+ your service is ready to use - that is, once you are connected to production someone could use it for the purpose set out in the use case you submitted as part of your application for the DCS pilot
+ your service has successfully handled the three outcomes from the [test requests](/send-a-test-request-to-the-DCS) you sent to the DCS integration environment (`valid: true`, `valid: false` and `error: true`)
+ you have an auditing system set up to keep a record of each request you make to DCS, including the [requestID and timestamp](https://dcs-pilot-docs.cloudapps.digital/sign-and-encrypt-a-DCS-payload/#build-a-plain-json-payload) of each request

The DCS team will get in touch with you with the next steps.
