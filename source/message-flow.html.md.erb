# Message flow

The Document Checking Service (DCS) acts as an interface between your client and Her Majesty's Passport Office (HMPO).

<%= image_tag "dcs-overview.svg" %>

1. A [passport check][check-passport] request is sent to the DCS.
2. Provided the request is from a trusted client, is signed and encrypted correctly, then the request is forwarded to HMPO.
3. HMPO responds to the provided request. The response can have three potential states:
    - The passport check is valid.
    - The passport check is invalid.
    - Something is wrong with HMPO.
4. The response is forwarded to the client as outlined in [check if a passport is valid; response][check-passport-response].
