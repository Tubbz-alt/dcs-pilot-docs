# Message flow

The Document Checking Service (DCS) acts as an interface between your client and Her Majesty's Passport Office (HMPO).

<%= image_tag "dcs-overview.svg" %>

1. A client sends a [passport check][check-passport] request to the DCS.
2. After authentication to prove the request is from a trusted client and the client has signed and encrypted the payload correctly, the DCS sends the request to HMPO.
3. HMPO responds to the provided request. The response can have three possible states:
    - The passport check is valid
    - The passport check is invalid
    - HMPO has an internal server error
4. The DCS sends the response to the client as outlined in [check if a passport is valid][check-passport-response].
