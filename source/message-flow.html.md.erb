# Message flow

The Document Checking Service (DCS) acts as an interface between your client and Her Majesty's Passport Office (HMPO).

<%= image_tag "dcs-overview.svg" %>

A client in your application makes a request over a secure HTTP connection to DCS. After handling the authentication, DCS forwards the request to HMPO. Then HMPO sends a response back to DCS which interprets the response. DCS then sends response back to your application indicating if the passport is valid or not.
