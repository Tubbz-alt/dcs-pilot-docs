# Message flow

The Document Checking Service (DCS) acts as an interface between your client and HM Passport Office (HMPO).

<%= image_tag "dcs-overview.svg" %>

1. Your client sends a [passport check][check-passport] request to the DCS.
2. After the DCS confirms the request came from your client and has not been tampered with, the DCS sends the request to HMPO.
3. HMPO checks the passport data against their database and sends a response back to the DCS.
4. The DCS sends the response to your client as outlined in [check if a passport is valid][check-passport-response].
