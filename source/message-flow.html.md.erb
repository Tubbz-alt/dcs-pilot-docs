# Message flow

The Document Checking Service (DCS) acts as an interface between your service and HM Passport Office.

<%= image_tag "dcs-overview.svg", { :alt => '' } %>

1. Your service sends a [passport check][check-passport] request to the DCS.
2. The DCS validates the request and sends it to HM Passport Office.
3. HM Passport Office checks the passport data against their database and sends a response back to the DCS.
4. The DCS sends the response to your service as outlined in [check if a passport is valid][check-passport-response].

## Mutual authentication

Mutual authentication secures the messages your client exchanges with the DCS. This is implemented using client certificates over [Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2][TLS].

You must generate a private key and certificate signing request to obtain your mutual authentication certificate.

Details about how to raise a certificate signing request with our Certificate Authority will follow after the expression of interest stage of the DCS pilot.
