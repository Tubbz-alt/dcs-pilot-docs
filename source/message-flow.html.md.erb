# Message flow

The Document Checking Service (DCS) acts as an interface between your client and HM Passport Office (HMPO).

<%= image_tag "dcs-overview.svg" %>

1. Your client sends a [passport check][check-passport] request to the DCS.
2. After the DCS confirms the request came from your client and has not been tampered with, the DCS sends the request to HMPO.
3. HMPO checks the passport data against their database and sends a response back to the DCS.
4. The DCS sends the response to your client as outlined in [check if a passport is valid][check-passport-response].
## Mutual Authentication
## Mutual authentication

Mutual authentication secures the messages your client exchanges with the DCS. This is implemented using client certificates over [Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2][TLS].

You must generate a private key and certificate signing request to obtain your mutual authentication certificate.

Details about how to raise a certificate signing request with our Certificate Authority will follow after the expression of interest phase of the DCS pilot.
