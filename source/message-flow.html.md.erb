# Message flow

The Document Checking Service (DCS) acts as an interface between your client and Her Majesty's Passport Office (HMPO).

<%= image_tag "dcs-overview.svg" %>

1. A client in your application makes a secure HTTP request to DCS. 
2. After authentication, DCS forwards the request to HMPO. 
3. HMPO responds to DCS which interprets the response. 
4. DCS responds to your application indicating if the passport is valid or not.
