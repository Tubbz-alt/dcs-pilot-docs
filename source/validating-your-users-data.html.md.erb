# Validating your users’ data

When building your service, you should validate the data your users send to your service.

The Document Checking Service’s API reference contains [information about the validation errors](https://dcs-pilot-docs.cloudapps.digital/api-reference/#request-validation-error-messages) which can occur.

When writing error messages for your users, you can [follow GOV.UK Design System’s guidance on writing error messages](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-message/).
