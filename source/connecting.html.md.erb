# Connecting to the DCS

To set up your technical connection to the Document Checking Service (DCS), you will:

1. Implement an API client to talk to the DCS.
2. Test your implementation in a dedicated environment.
3. Go live in the production environment.

Your API client can either be one you've built yourself or you can use an 'off-the-shelf' HTTP client. Whichever option you choose, your client must be able to [handle authentication][cryptography] against the DCS API.

You will be able to test your API implementation in the test environment provided by GDS. This test environment contains test data to help you check that your application can handle all success and failure cases. To access the test environment, you must first get signed certificates from our Certificate Authority.

Once your application can handle all the API response scenarios, you are ready to go live in the production environment.

We aim to iterate our connecting process to continue to improve how organisations connect. Participants can expect that some things will change during the connecting window as we improve the process.
