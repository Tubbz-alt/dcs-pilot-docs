# Helping your users with their passport queries

It’s possible that as a result of using your service, a user might think something is wrong with their passport. This documentation will help you answer your users’ passport queries.

1. Be aware of known `valid: false` passport issues.
1. Allow your users to have the check made again.
1. Consider offering your users an alternative route.
1. Direct your users to the Passport Advice Line.

## Be aware of known `valid: false` passport issues

There’s a known issue with readings from the near-field communication (NFC) chips in passports. Some users may receive a false-negative result. There's [guidance on how to reduce errors when using data from a passport chip](/reading-data-from-passport-nfc-chip/#reduce-errors-when-using-data-from-a-passport-chip).

To make your users aware of this known possible issue, you could:

* reiterate this information in a separate email to your users
* flag this as a possible issue when you’re building your service so a user can adjust their input

## Allow your users to have the check made again

It's likely that a check will have failed due to user error, for example a user misspelling their name. Allowing your users to re-enter their details and have the check made again can help solve this problem.

## Consider offering your users an alternative route

You could offer your users alternative routes to access your service for example:

- if a user does not want to provide their passport details over the internet, you could offer them an in-person alternative
- if a user fails a DCS check, you could provide an alternative route to access your service without a DCS check being made

Even if a user can access your service through an alternative route, they may still have concerns about their passport validity. If this is the case, you should direct your users to the Passport Advice Line.

## Direct your users to the Passport Advice Line

If a DCS check has returned a `valid: false` response, your users may still have doubts about whether their passport is valid (or red-flagged).

You should [direct users in this position to the Passport Advice Line](https://www.gov.uk/passport-advice-line). This final check will give your users reassurance about whether their passport is valid.
