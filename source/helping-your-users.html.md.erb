# Helping your users with their passport queries

It’s possible that as a result of using your service, a user might think something is wrong with their passport. This documentation will help you answer your users’ passport queries.

1. Be aware of known `valid: false` passport issues.
1. Allow your users to have the check made again.
1. Consider offering your users an alternative route.
1. Direct your users to the Passport Advice Line.

## Be aware of known `valid: false` passport issues

There’s a known issue with readings from NFC chips. Some users may receive a false-negative result. There's [guidance on how to reduce errors when using data from a passport chip](/reading-data-from-passport-nfc-chip/#reduce-errors-when-using-data-from-a-passport-chip).

To make your users aware of this known possible issue, you could:

* reiterate this information in a separate email to your users
* flag this as a possible issue when you’re building your service so a user can adjust their input

## Allow your users to have the check made again

If the check fails for any reason, for example a user misspelling their name, you should allow your users to re-enter their details and have the check made again.

## Consider offering your users an alternative route

Your service could give users an alternative way to use the service if they do not have a British passport, or do not want their passport details to be checked in this way. A user can use this alternative route to access your service without a DCS check being made.

However, even though a user can now access your service, they may still have concerns about their passport validity. If this is the case, you should direct your users to the Passport Advice Line.

## Direct your users to the Passport Advice Line

If a DCS check has returned a `valid: false` response, your users may still have doubts about whether their passport is valid (or red-flagged).

You should [direct users in this position to the Passport Advice Line](https://www.gov.uk/passport-advice-line). This final check will give your users reassurance about whether their passport is valid.
