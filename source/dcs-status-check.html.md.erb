# Check the DCS status

You can check the status of the Document Checking Service (DCS) by making a GET request on the service endpoint.

It is up to you to decide how to use this call to build appropriate levels of reliability into your app.

You can also check the operational status of the Document Checking Service on the [GOV.UK Verify status page].

## Request

`GET: https://<DCS-URI>/checks/passport`

The `<DCS-URI>` will be supplied at a later date.

As part of the GET request, the client will be required to pass their SSL certificate to authenticate themselves. If it’s not supplied, or if it’s incorrect, an `"Untrusted Certificate"` response will be returned. The SSL certificate should be passed in the request header, and be named  `X-ssl-client-s-dn`.

## Response

The responses to the status request can be:

* `Limit exceeded`, if you went beyond the rate limit.
* `Scheduled outage`, if for example DCS or HMPO are doing routine maintenance
* `Untrusted Certificate`, if your SSL certificate sent in the header is incorrect
* `Unplanned outage`, if something else went wrong, used as a catch-all).

For example, if you made the request during an outage period the JSON object in the response body without the [signature and encryption wrapper][cryptography] will be similar to:

```json
{
  "available": false,
  "message": "Planned outage in progress finishing 2019-09-12T00:00:00.000Z",
  "scheduledOutages":
    [
      {
      	"start":"2019-09-05T00:00:00.000Z",
      	"end":"2019-09-12T00:00:00.000Z",
      	"message":"HMPO is doing some maintenance work."
      }
